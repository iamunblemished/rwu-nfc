## 📖 Description

The NFC Access Control System is an embedded security solution designed for educational institutions, laboratories, and small-to-medium scale access control applications. Built on the Arduino platform with the industry-standard PN532 NFC module, it combines simplicity with advanced features like intelligent card cloning, multi-card authorization, and real-time access management.

### What Makes This Project Unique?

Unlike traditional access control systems, this project implements **custom sector card cloning technology** that works with standard Mifare Classic cards—no expensive "magic cards" required. The system intelligently manages both physical and cloned UIDs, providing flexible access control without the limitations of conventional NFC systems.

### Key Highlights

- 🔒 **Secure**: Local card database with EEPROM persistence, no network dependencies
- ⚡ **Fast**: IRQ-based card detection with <100ms response time
- 🎯 **Smart**: Automatic UID selection (cloned vs. physical)
- 🖥️ **User-Friendly**: Interactive LCD menu with intuitive button navigation
- 🔧 **Flexible**: Support for up to 40 authorized cards with easy management
- 📚 **Well-Documented**: Comprehensive Sphinx documentation with diagrams
- 🛠️ **Professional**: Built with PlatformIO for modern embedded development

### Dependencies
- Adafruit PN532 v1.3.4
- LiquidCrystal v1.0.7
- SPI (built-in)
- Wire (built-in)
- EEPROM (built-in)

## How It Works

### Card Detection & Custom Sector
When a card is scanned:
1. **Read Physical UID** from block 0 (manufacturer, read-only)
2. **Read Custom Sector 1** (blocks 4-7) for cloned UID
3. **Use Effective UID** for access control:
   - If custom sector has cloned UID → use cloned UID
   - Otherwise → use physical manufacturer UID

### Custom Sector Structure (Block 4)
```
Byte 0-1:   Magic bytes (0xAC, 0xDB) - Identifies initialized card
Byte 2:     UID length (0-7)
Byte 3-9:   Cloned UID (up to 7 bytes)
Byte 10-15: Reserved for future use
```

### Card Cloning Process
1. **Select Clone from Menu**
2. **Scan Source Card**
   - System reads effective UID (cloned if present, otherwise physical)
   - Display shows "Remove & scan new"
3. **Remove Source Card**
   - Automatic timeout (1 second) detects removal
   - IRQ detection restarts for next card
4. **Scan Target Card** (must be Mifare Classic 1K/4K)
   - System writes source UID to target's Sector 1
   - Verifies write operation
   - Target now acts as source card

### Access Control Logic
```cpp
// Card scanned
if (hasClonedUID) {
    checkUID = clonedUID;  // From Sector 1
} else {
    checkUID = physicalUID;  // From block 0
}

if (isAuthorized(checkUID)) {
    grantAccess();
    unlockDoor(3000ms);
}
```

## Menu System

### Main Menu (Long-press SELECT)
- **Register Card**: Add new card to authorized list
- **Delete Card**: Remove card from authorized list
- **List Cards**: Browse stored cards (UP/DOWN to navigate)
- **Clone Card**: Copy UID from one card to another
- **Settings**: System configuration
- **Clear All**: Remove all authorized cards
- **Exit Menu**: Return to scan mode

### Navigation
- **UP/DOWN**: Navigate menu items or list cards
- **SELECT**: Confirm selection
- **BACK**: Return to previous screen/exit menu
- **LONG PRESS SELECT**: Open menu from main screen

## Serial Monitor Output

### Normal Card Scan
```
Physical UID: 12 34 56 78
Access GRANTED
```

### Cloned Card Scan
```
Physical UID: AA BB CC DD
Cloned UID: 12 34 56 78 (from Sector 1)
Access GRANTED
```

### Clone Operation
```
Clone source UID: 12 34 56 78
(Using physical manufacturer UID)
Remove source card and scan target card...
Target card detected, cloning to custom sector...
Cloning UID to sector 1: 12 34 56 78
Writing cloned UID to block 4: 12 34 56 78
Clone write SUCCESS
Clone VERIFIED!
NFC reader reset, ready for next card
```

## Configuration

Edit `include/Config.h` to customize:

```cpp
// Access Control
#define RELAY_ACTIVE_HIGH  true    // Relay trigger level
#define DOOR_UNLOCK_TIME   3000    // Door unlock duration (ms)
#define MAX_STORED_CARDS   40      // Maximum authorized cards

// Timing
#define MESSAGE_DISPLAY_TIME  2000  // Status message duration
#define MENU_TIMEOUT          30000 // Auto-exit menu timeout
#define CARD_TIMEOUT          1000  // Card removal detection

// NFC Mode
#define NFC_COMM_MODE  NFC_COMM_SPI     // SPI or I2C
#define NFC_READ_MODE  NFC_READ_IRQ     // IRQ or POLLING
```

## EEPROM Storage

### Memory Map
| Address | Content | Size |
|---------|---------|------|
| 0-1 | Magic number (0xABCD) | 2 bytes |
| 2 | Card count | 1 byte |
| 4+ | Card storage | 9 bytes/card |

### Card Storage Format (per card)
```
Byte 0:   UID length
Byte 1:   Active flag
Byte 2-8: UID data (7 bytes max)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Card Not Detected
- Check PN532 wiring (especially SPI pins)
- Verify IRQ pin connected to D2
- Check Serial Monitor for "PN532 NOT FOUND!"
- Ensure card is Mifare Classic 1K/4K or NTAG

### Clone Not Working
- **Target must be Mifare Classic 1K or 4K**
- NTAG/Ultralight cards not supported for clone target
- Check authentication (default key: FF FF FF FF FF FF)
- Verify custom sector is writable

### Reading Stops After First Card
- Remove card completely before scanning again
- Wait 1 second for card removal detection
- Check Serial Monitor for "Card removed, restarting detection"

### Display Issues
- Check LCD contrast (potentiometer adjustment)
- Verify 4-bit parallel wiring
- Check power supply (5V, stable)

### Buttons Not Responding
- Verify active LOW configuration
- Check internal pullups enabled
- Test button continuity
- Adjust debounce time if needed

## Technical Details

### Non-Blocking Architecture
- All operations use `millis()` for timing
- No `delay()` calls in main loop
- IRQ-driven card detection
- Maintains responsive button handling

### Memory Optimization
- Flash: ~20KB / 30KB (66%)
- RAM: ~1.1KB / 2KB (55%)
- PROGMEM used for strings
- Efficient EEPROM usage

### Security Considerations
- Default Mifare key used (FF FF...)
- Physical UID remains untouched
- Custom sector can be overwritten
- Not suitable for high-security applications
- Designed for access convenience, not cryptographic security

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Clone Support
- Clone one card to multiple targets
- All clones act as original card
- Each clone retains unique physical UID
- Effective for distributing access

### Card Re-cloning
- Can clone a cloned card
- System automatically uses effective UID
- Enables card duplication chains

### Blank Card Detection
- System detects uninitialized cards
- Shows physical UID for new cards
- Custom sector created on first clone
